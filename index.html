            <p>Pierre Terrail, seigneur de Bayard (c. 1476 – 30 April 1524) was a French knight at the transition between the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, 
                generally known as the Chevalier de Bayard. Throughout the centuries since his death, he has been known as "the knight without fear and beyond reproach" 
                (le chevalier sans peur et sans reproche). He himself preferred the name given him by his contemporaries for his gaiety and kindness, "le bon chevalier", or "the good knight". </p>

            <p>As a soldier, Bayard was considered the epitome of chivalry and one of the most skillful commanders of the age. 
                He was noted for the exactitude and completeness of his information on the enemy's movements, which he obtained by careful reconnaissance and a well-arranged system of espionage. 
                In the long history of mounted warfare, he rates as one of the greatest cavalry leaders of all time. </p>
